# Test Scenario:

Objective: Build a basic to-do list app using Flutter within 2 hours. The app should allow users to add,
delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Requirements:
Create a Flutter project with a to-do list screen.
Implement a list view to display tasks.
Add a button to add new tasks.
Implement a feature to mark tasks as completed (e.g., with a checkbox).
Allow users to delete tasks.
Use a state management approach of your choice (e.g., StatefulWidget, Provider, Bloc) to
manage the app&#39;s state.
Add basic styling to make the app visually appealing.
Ensure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Implement proper error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty task input).
Write tests for critical components of your app, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as
completed, and deleting tasks.



# Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: Does the app meet all the specified requirements? Does it allow users to add, delete, and
mark tasks as completed?

Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and organized? Are best practices followed in terms of naming
conventions and code readability?

State Management: Is an appropriate state management approach used, and is the state managed
effectively?

UI/UX: Is the app visually appealing and user-friendly? Is it responsive on different screen sizes?



Error Handling: Are edge cases handled gracefully? Is there appropriate error handling in place?

Testing: Are tests written to ensure the critical functionality of the app works as expected? Are the tests
well-documented and easy to understand?

Completion: Was the task completed within the 2-hour time frame?

This test scenario covers various aspects of Flutter development, including UI design, state
management, error handling, and testing. It&#39;s designed to assess a developer&#39;s proficiency in building a
functional Flutter app within a limited time frame. Adjust the complexity of the test based on the skill
level of the developer being evaluated.
